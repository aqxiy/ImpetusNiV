## Optimizing the modern PC arrival

## The science is over my head frankly, probably a sweet spot to attaining frequency, multiprocessing, power loading and cache coordination. Try looking at comparison benchmarks with the naked eye - I think this stuff is fascinating.

## This is the best I've seen a game look, ever:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHu_R9DoUnQ

# Computer build

### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600

### GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT

### KEY tip: If on 60Hz, follow below procedure:
AMD GPU fluid rendition hack: enable GPU scaling, enable integer scaling, disable integer scaling, restart PC. All else default.

## Build advice

Btw, angle PC case outward from desk which is to the right of the computer at around 6.5 degrees, probs just 5-10 range but I settled on 6.5. Can check by measuring with ruler or tape and doing inverse tangent. Front of case jutting out maybe .5 - 1 inch. Seems to do better for EMF and thermals. Just my 2 cents with Cooler Master Q300L V2.

&, use 2.4ghz && Looking toward rear of case from front, angle left antenna on rotating axis 15-25 degrees up and extended at 45 degree on its hinge facing left. Right antenna has hinge inward, antenna straight with edge parallel to horizon

Wireless Mode: auto
